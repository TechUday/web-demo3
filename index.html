<p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, 
information engineering, computer science, and others. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well
 as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.</p>

<p>These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be used in many 
situations and for lots of purposes, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation),
 manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive (e.g. in space, under water, in high heat, and clean up and containment of
 hazardous materials and radiation). Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help
 in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking,
 lifting, speech, cognition, or any other human activity. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of
 bio-inspired robotics.</p>

<p>The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times, but research into the functionality and
 potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the 20th century. Throughout history, it has been frequently assumed by
 various scholars, inventors, engineers, and technicians that robots will one day be able to mimic human behavior and manage tasks in
 a human-like fashion. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and 
building new robots serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do 
jobs that are hazardous to people, such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring mines and shipwrecks. 
Robotics is also used in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as a teaching aid.[1] The advent of nanorobots,
 microscopic robots that can be injected into the human body, could revolutionize medicine and human health.[2]</p>

<p>Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field overlaps
 with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.[3]The word robotics was 
derived from the word robot, which was introduced to the public by Czech writer Karel Capek in his play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)
, which was published in 1920.[4] The word robot comes from the Slavic word robota, which means labour/work. The play begins in a factory 
that makes artificial people called robots, creatures who can be mistaken for humans – very similar to the modern ideas of androids. Karel
 Capek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the Oxford English Dictionary in which he
 named his brother Josef Capek as its actual originator.[4]</p>

<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov, in his science fiction short 
story "Liar!", published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction. Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term; since the science
 and technology of electrical devices is electronics, he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots. In
 some of Asimov's other works, he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround (Astounding Science
 Fiction, March 1942),[5][6] where he introduced his concept of The Three Laws of Robotics. However, the original publication of "Liar!"
 predates that of "Runaround" by ten months, so the former is generally cited as the word's origin.There are many types of robots; they
 are used in many different environments and for many different uses, although being very diverse in application and form they all share
 three basic similarities when it comes to their construction:</p>

<p>Robots all have some kind of mechanical construction, a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot
 designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud, might use caterpillar tracks. The mechanical aspect is mostly the creator's solution to 
completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function.
Robots have electrical components which power and control the machinery. For example, the robot with caterpillar tracks would need
 some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and
 originate from a battery, a basic electrical circuit. Even petrol powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require
 an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical
 aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound,
 position, and energy status) and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to
 activate and perform basic operations)
All robots contain some level of computer programming code. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the 
caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive
 the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core 
essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly constructed its
 performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control,
 artificial intelligence and hybrid. A robot with remote control programing has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform
 if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with a remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate
 to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that use
 artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects
 and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. Hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC
 functions.</p></article>
