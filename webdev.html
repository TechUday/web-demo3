		<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1]
 Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web-based internet applications 
(web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly 
refers, may include web engineering, web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server
 and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

<p>Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and
 coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical
 skills.</p>

<p>For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers) and follow standard
 methods like Agile methodologies while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting
 developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web
 development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three
 kinds of web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers
 responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.Since the
 commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses
 wishing to use their website to advertise and sell products and services to customers.[3]</p>

<p>There are many open source tools for web development such as BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and
 Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry
 has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
 Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be
 learned and implemented quickly.</p>

<p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers build more dynamic and interactive websites. Further, web developers
 now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This
 has allowed for many opportunities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud
 services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and Google Drive. These web services allow users to interact with applications from many
 locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>

<p>Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce led by web development include e-commerce. Online auction sites such
 as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services. Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com (among
 many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting experience for many consumers. Another example of transformative
 communication led by web development is the blog. Web applications such as WordPress and Movable Type have created blog-environments
 for individual websites. The increased usage of open-source content management systems and enterprise content management systems has
 extended web development's impact at online interaction and communication.</p>

<p>Web development has also impacted personal networking and marketing. Websites are no longer simply tools for work or for commerce,
 but serve more broadly for communication and social networking. Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter provide users with a platform
 to communicate and organizations with a more personal and interactive way to engage the public.Testing is the process of evaluating a
 system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. Testing is executing a
 system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements contrary to the actual requirements. The extent of testing varies
 greatly between organizations, developers, and individual sites or applications.</p>
